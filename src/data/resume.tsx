  summary:
    "Hi, I’m **Thuy Nguyen**, a curious UX/UI designer passionate about creating intuitive digital experiences. I’ve interned at leading companies such as **TikTok Shop**, **ELSA Speak**, and **Innisfree**, giving me a strong understanding of both user needs and business perspectives. Beyond that, I gained hands-on experience in product design at **FireGroup**, freelanced with **Wedlify**, and challenged myself in the **Mingg UI Challenge**. Blending logic with creativity, I turn research-driven insights into engaging, user-friendly products. I’m always eager to learn, grow, and bring fresh perspectives to every project I work on. ",
