## Overview  

**Wedlify** is a digital platform that helps couples create, manage, and share their wedding invitations online.  
I took full ownership of the project — from design concept to a coded live version.  
This included crafting the **brand visuals**, building responsive layouts, and **translating the Figma design into a real website** using React and Vercel.

The goal was to build more than a standard wedding invitation tool — a modern, heartfelt, and visually delightful experience for Vietnamese users.

## The 'Why' Behind Wedlify  

My client wanted to introduce a **modern, authentic wedding tool** that could resonate with young Vietnamese couples.

- Designed from the hero section outward, ensuring consistent flow and tone.  
- Applied **UntitledUI Design System** for consistent spacing, typography, and component scaling.  
- After final approval, I **developed the live website myself**, using:

  - **Vercel** for deployment and hosting
