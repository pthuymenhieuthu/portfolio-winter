## Overview  

**Wedlify** is a digital platform that helps couples create, manage, and share their wedding invitations online.  
I took ownership of both **design and front-end execution**, turning my Figma prototype into a responsive, coded demo.  
This included shaping the **visual identity**, defining component systems, and styling the layout with **HTML and CSS**.

The goal was to craft more than a basic wedding invitation tool — a modern, heartfelt, and visually charming experience tailored for Vietnamese users.

My client wanted to create a **modern yet emotional wedding tool** that resonates with young Vietnamese couples.  
The challenge was to blend **SaaS-like clarity** with **romantic visual storytelling**, keeping the interface functional but full of personality.

It also reinforced my belief that **great design extends beyond Figma**: it’s about building something people can truly interact with.
