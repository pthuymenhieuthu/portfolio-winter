## Overview  

During my freelance project with **Wedlify**, I led the design of a complete digital wedding platform — from concept to responsive prototype. The goal: deliver more than a typical invitation tool; create a fresh, personal, and charming experience for Vietnamese users.

## The 'Why' Behind Wedlify  

My client aimed to launch a wedding tool that felt **authentic and modern**, setting it apart from anything in Vietnam. The project began with a clear brief and strong style direction, which fueled a process full of intention and charm.
