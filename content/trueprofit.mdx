publishedAt: "2024-11-01"
summary: "During my internship at TrueProfit, I redesigned onboarding illustrations to improve engagement and supported the landing page design with layout drafts and brand-aligned visuals."
---

## Overview  

During my internship, I worked on two design tasks closely tied to **user experience and brand consistency**:  

1. **Redesigning onboarding illustrations** to increase engagement and reduce skip rates.  
2. **Supporting the landing page design** by drafting layout ideas and illustrations aligned with the brand system.  

Both tasks required me to translate abstract product goals into **clear visual storytelling**, while keeping alignment with the existing design system and marketing direction.

## Task 1: Onboarding Illustrations  

### Problem  
- Existing onboarding flow felt disconnected from branding.  
- High skip rate, low survey completion → less insight for the internal team.  
- Illustrations focused too much on “UI decoration” instead of guiding the **UX journey**.

### Process  
- **Brief & Goal Setting**: Clarified KPIs → reduce skips, increase survey completion.  
- **User Journey Mapping**: Used Empathy Map (Sees / Thinks / Feels / Does) to define what users experience before, during, and after onboarding.

- **Brand Alignment**: Pulled assets from design system + landing page to keep visual consistency across touchpoints.

- **Sketch → References → Final**: Sketched rough flows, refined with references, then applied style guide to finalize.  
- **Feedback Loop**: Shared drafts with leader/dev → iterated quickly on sketches.  
- **Handoff**: Exported assets in Figma with context notes for developers.  

### Outcome  
A set of illustrations that:  
- Fit seamlessly with the brand identity.  
- Guided users smoothly through onboarding instead of distracting them.  
- Supported KPIs: encouraged more survey completions and reduced skips.

## Task 2: Landing Page Support  

### Problem  
- Landing page needed a refreshed layout to clearly highlight product value.  
- Although the design system was available, layout and illustration direction needed to reinforce the product story.  

### Process  
- **Research & Audit**: Reviewed current landing page + competitor SaaS websites.  
- **Persona Mapping**: Defined key personas (store owners, marketers) and mapped their needs to different landing sections.  
- **Draft Layout**: Sketched rough layout flow (hero → features → social proof → CTA) with a clear hierarchy.  
- **Illustration Support**: Proposed key visuals per section consistent with the brand system.  
- **Feedback & Refinement**: Adjusted drafts based on stakeholder input for clarity and alignment.  

### Outcome  
- Draft landing page layout with illustrations that highlighted product features without overloading text.  
- Visual continuity between **website → app onboarding**, creating a smoother user journey.  
- Clearer draft flow made it easier for dev handoff.
