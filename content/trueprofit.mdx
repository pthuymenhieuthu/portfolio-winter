## About  

At TrueProfit, I took on two key responsibilities:  

1. **Support in designing the landing page** for [trueprofit.io](https://trueprofit.io/), aimed at marketing and user acquisition.  
2. **Design onboarding illustrations** for the in-app experience, ensuring a friendly and coherent visual style aligned with the product's identity.
