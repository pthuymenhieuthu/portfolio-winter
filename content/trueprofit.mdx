publishedAt: "2024-01"

---

## Overview  

During my internship, I worked on two design tasks closely tied to **user experience and brand consistency**:  

1. **Redesigning onboarding illustrations** to increase engagement and reduce skip rates.  
2. **Supporting the landing page design** for [trueprofit.io](https://trueprofit.io/) by drafting layout ideas and illustrations aligned with the brand system.  

Both tasks required me to translate abstract product goals into **clear visual storytelling**, while keeping alignment with the existing design system and marketing direction.

## Task 1: Landing Page Support  

### Problem  
- The TrueProfit marketing website [trueprofit.io](https://trueprofit.io/) required additional visuals to better showcase product value across its main pages.  
- The design system and content were already prepared, but the project needed **illustration and layout support** to complete the visual design.  

### My Role & Contributions  
From **November until the website launch in January**, my responsibilities included:  
- **Creating illustrations** for the **Home page** and **Features page** based on the existing design file.  
- **Drafting layout and illustration concepts** for the **Partners page**, a subpage dedicated to collaborations.  
- Ensuring illustrations followed the established brand system and maintained consistency with the in-app onboarding style.  

### Process  
- Received the in-progress design file and content from the design team --> Identified keywords for reference illustration and feeling

- Designed **illustrations** that matched the page structure and emphasized key product highlights.  
- Drafted the **Partners page layout** and produced illustration concepts to support its storytelling.  
- Iterated with feedback from the design lead and marketing team until final approval.  

### Outcome  
- Delivered final **illustrations for the Home and Features pages** integrated into the website.  
- Produced **layout and visual drafts** for the Partners page, ensuring consistent branding.

## Task 2: Onboarding Illustrations  

### Problem  
- Existing onboarding flow felt disconnected from branding on [trueprofit.io](https://trueprofit.io/).  
- High skip rate, low survey completion → less insight for the internal team.  
- Illustrations focused too much on “UI decoration” instead of guiding the **UX journey**.

### Process  
- **Brief & Goal Setting**: Clarified KPIs → reduce skips, increase survey completion.  
- **User Journey Mapping**: Used Empathy Map (Sees / Thinks / Feels / Does) to define what users experience before, during, and after onboarding.

![Process Step 2](https://res.cloudinary.com/dqtfjvkok/image/upload/v1758730723/03_diajt3.png) 

- **Brand Alignment**: Pulled assets from design system + landing page to keep visual consistency across touchpoints.

![Process Step 3](https://res.cloudinary.com/dqtfjvkok/image/upload/v1758730723/05_wo4zax.png)  

- **Sketch → References → Final**: Sketched rough flows, refined with references, then applied style guide to finalize.  
- **Feedback Loop**: Shared drafts with leader/dev → iterated quickly on sketches.  
- **Handoff**: Exported assets in Figma with context notes for developers.

### Outcome  
A set of illustrations that:  
- Fit seamlessly with the brand identity.  
- Guided users smoothly through onboarding instead of distracting them.  
- Supported KPIs: encouraged more survey completions and reduced skips.
