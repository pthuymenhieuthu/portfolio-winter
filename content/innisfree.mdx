**Challenge**: Through my experience, I identified the need for strategic improvements to enhance revenue and maintain competitiveness specifically in the beauty e-commerce landing page sector..

**Solution**: Create a more appealing shopping journey that encourages customers to stay, explore, and complete their purchases.
