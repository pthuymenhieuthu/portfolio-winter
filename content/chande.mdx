## My Design Process during Chande

### Brief Analysis
I start by carefully analyzing the challenge prompt to understand the expected output, constraints, and user needs.

### Direction Setting
Next, I define the overall art direction — including layout structure, font pairing, color palette, and shape language that best fit the concept.

### Drafting Hero Section & Layout
I sketch out the layout and begin designing the hero section to establish the tone and hierarchy for the rest of the page.

### Final Design & Prototyping using framer
Once the layout is locked in, I polish the visuals and bring everything to life with interactive prototyping in Framer.
