## WEEK 4 CHALLENGE BRIEF

**Prompt:**  
“Dear contestants, aka the people I get to ‘hire’ without paying a dime.  

I don’t have the budget to hire a branding designer, and the product doesn’t have an MVP yet.  
I’m looking to build a website that I can show off, use for fundraising, and start drawing attention from the community.  

I already have a logo — could you suggest some fonts and color palettes that will make the site feel friendly and give off that ‘wow’ factor at first glance?  

I’m not sure if this content works well. Could you suggest some improvements or alternatives for me?”  

### Design faster, think smarter — with your AI design partner

From wireframes to UI copy, your ideas become interfaces in seconds.  
No more staring at a blank canvas. Just prompt, tweak, and go.  

Optional: *Illustration or looping demo showing prompt → layout → final UI*

#### Key Features

**Prompt to UI**  
Just describe what you need. Our AI instantly generates clean, editable UI layouts tailored to your idea.

**Smart copy, built-in**  
Get on-brand headings, CTAs, and microcopy — no need to switch tabs or call your copywriter.

**Export to Figma**  
Match your brand’s voice, color, or layout system without lifting a finger.

**Export to Code**  
Need code? We’ve got that too. Generate clean HTML/CSS/React code, ready for developers.

**Real-time iteration**  
Tweak your prompt. Add a new section. Edit content. All in seconds — with instant visual updates.

### How it works

Go from an idea in your head… to a working UI in minutes.  
We combine smart prompts, structured layout systems, and flexible exports to help you design — and deliver — at lightning speed.

1. **Write your prompt**  
   Tweak your prompt. Add a new section. Edit content. All in seconds — with instant visual updates.  

2. **Generate layout, structure & content**  
   - Auto-generate a responsive layout based on common UI patterns  
   - Fill in with AI-written copy: titles, descriptions, CTAs  
   - Instantly editable before you export  

3. **Customize your design**  
   - Tweak layout directly  
   - Replace images, reorder sections  
   - Adjust tone, design intent, or use design tokens (if available)  

4. **Export to Figma or Code**  
   Send to Figma with one click — fully layered, auto-layout ready  
   Export as production-ready code (HTML/CSS/React)

## My Design Process during Chande

### Brief Analysis
I start by carefully analyzing the challenge prompt to understand the expected output, constraints, and user needs.  

### Direction Setting
Next, I define the overall art direction — including layout structure, font pairing, color palette, and shape language that best fit the concept.

### Drafting Hero Section & Layout
I sketch out the layout and begin designing the hero section to establish the tone and hierarchy for the rest of the page.

### Final Design & Prototyping using Figma and Framer
Once the layout is locked in, I polish the visuals and bring everything to life with interactive prototyping in Framer and Figma.
