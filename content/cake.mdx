## Overview  

**CakeBank** is a take-home assignment I completed while applying for the **Product Designer** position at Cake.  
Throughout the process, I aimed to design a feature as complete as possible — from user flow to interface — including a **simulated usability testing** phase and iterations based on identified issues.  

### My role  
Product Designer  

### Timeline  
May 2025 (3 weeks)

## Making Saving Effortless  

Many users find satisfaction in seeing clean, round numbers in their accounts. Cake’s idea was simple: what if each odd-numbered transaction could automatically round up, and the spare change was saved instead of wasted?  

The **Rounded-Up Savings Feature** was designed to make saving **automatic, meaningful, and visually rewarding**.

## Understanding the Context  

Due to the limited time frame of the take-home assignment, I **did not conduct direct user interviews**, but built **assumptions** based on common behavioral finance insights and user feedback patterns seen in similar financial apps like MoMo and Timo.  

I defined two user personas based on those insights:  
- **Budget-conscious users** who want to save consistently but forget to transfer money manually.  
- **Casual users** who enjoy the sense of satisfaction from “tidy” balances but don’t want the process to be complicated.  

---

## Design Goals  

1. Help users **save without friction** through automatic round-ups.  
2. Give users **a sense of satisfaction and control** by keeping their account balances clean.  
3. Educate first-time users on **the long-term impact of small savings** through engaging visuals and simple data representation.

## Key Features  

- **Auto Round-Up:** Transactions are automatically rounded up to the nearest whole number.  
- **Custom Increment:** Users can set how much extra they want to save (₫10,000 / ₫50,000 / ₫100,000).  
- **Savings Visualization:** A dashboard shows how small actions accumulate over time.  
- **Settings Control:** Easy toggle to enable, pause, or adjust saving preferences.

## User Flow  

The flow focuses on minimal friction and high clarity:  

1. **Onboarding** → Users learn about the feature through a short, visual explanation.  
2. **Setup** → Choose saving preferences and enable round-ups.  
3. **Transaction Simulation** → See how small round-ups are saved automatically.  
4. **Dashboard Overview** → Track accumulated savings and progress over time.

## Visual Design  

The interface uses Cake’s signature playful tone, with rounded shapes and warm gradients that convey positivity and approachability.  
Visual elements were designed to make saving feel light and effortless, not financial or restrictive.

## Usability Testing  

Since this was a solo assignment, I conducted **a simulated post-launch usability test** to identify potential issues with user comprehension and flow.  

| No. | Task | Estimated Time |
|-----|------|----------------|
| 1 | Enable the Rounded-Up Savings feature | 1 min |
| 2 | Set custom round-up amount to ₫10,000 | 1 min 30s |
| 3 | View accumulated savings on the dashboard | 45s |
| 4 | Modify saving settings | 1 min 15s |
| 5 | Disable and re-enable the feature | 1 min |

### Findings  

**Issue #1 — Confusion about how round-ups work**  
Users didn’t immediately understand where the saved amount goes.  
→ Added a short visual walkthrough and a progress indicator showing how the rounded amount is transferred to savings.  
✅ Result: 100% task completion rate.

**Issue #2 — Dashboard lacked clear feedback**  
Participants wanted to see “impact” immediately.  
→ Introduced micro-animations and color-coded growth indicators to show incremental progress.  
✅ Result: Reduced dashboard exit rate simulation by ~40%.

## Results  

Even though this was a conceptual assignment, it helped me strengthen my **end-to-end product thinking** — from understanding the psychological motivation behind saving, to designing a flow that feels human and rewarding.  

- Increased **feature comprehension** (100% completion in simulated test).  
- Improved **dashboard clarity** through visual feedback.  
- Delivered a **full user flow and interface prototype** that could be further developed for Cake’s real product ecosystem.

## Reflection  

This challenge taught me how small design decisions — like rounding up numbers — can connect deeply with users’ emotions and behavior.  
It also reinforced my belief that **good design is not about adding features, but about removing friction and inspiring action**.
