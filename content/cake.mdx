## Making Saving Feel Effortless  

When I first read Cake’s brief, it reminded me of a small, almost invisible frustration — that moment when you see **49,327₫** in your balance and it just feels… unfinished. Many users don’t consciously realize it, but those messy numbers create a subtle sense of unease.  

That’s where the idea began: **what if every transaction could end neatly — and secretly help you save at the same time?**

## Turning a Quirk into a Habit  

The challenge was to turn a psychological quirk — the discomfort with odd numbers — into a **feature that builds saving habits**.  
My goal wasn’t only to make balances look cleaner, but to make users *feel* better about their money.  

Saving can often feel heavy and intentional; I wanted it to feel **light, automatic, and satisfying.**

## Understanding the Opportunity  

Due to limited time, I built this concept based on assumptions about Cake’s existing audience — **young professionals aged 22–30**, who value ease, control, and emotional clarity in digital banking apps.  

Quick desk research from products like **Revolut**, **Monzo**, and **Timo** revealed:  
- Users trust *automation* when it’s transparent.  
- *Micro-saving* feels approachable if it’s visualized well.  
- Positive feedback loops encourage retention.  

These insights guided my flow and interface decisions.

## Designing the Experience  

### 1. Onboarding that feels like an invitation  
A 3-step onboarding that explains how rounding up works with simple examples:  
> “Spend 43,000₫ → Save 7,000₫.”  

The tone is friendly and optimistic, inspired by Cake’s brand personality.  

### 2. Customization for flexibility  
Users can select their preferred rounding rule:  
- Nearest 10,000₫, 50,000₫, or 100,000₫  
- Or a fixed increment per transaction  

### 3. A dashboard that visualizes progress  
A clean, minimal dashboard shows how much users have saved over time.  
Micro-interactions like confetti bursts celebrate milestones and make saving feel rewarding.  

### 4. Settings for control  
Users can toggle, modify, or disable the feature anytime — ensuring transparency and trust.

**Issue #2 – Customization not easy to find**  
50% of users struggled to locate the rounding rule setting.  
→ Moved it to the dashboard card with “Change rounding rule” label → Task time reduced from 1m30s → 50s.  

**Issue #3 – Dashboard felt static**  
Users wanted more encouragement.  
→ Added celebratory confetti when reaching milestones → Satisfaction increased from 3.8 → 4.5 / 5.

## Reflection  

Designing this feature taught me that **emotional design can influence behavior** — a clean balance can trigger a feeling of calm and accomplishment.  

By combining automation with emotional clarity, small actions can turn into long-term saving habits.  

**Next step:** Explore a *goal-based saving* extension (e.g., “Round up to save for your next trip”).
