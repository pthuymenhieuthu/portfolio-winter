Before starting this job, I kept asking myself:  
## “Will AI replace my role as a UI/UX Designer?”

But after taking ownership of this entire project — rebuilding the design system, redesigning the interface, and shaping the UI for Zoan AI — I realized something else:

👉 **I wasn’t being replaced by AI. I was designing the interface *for* an AI platform.**

## Overview

Zoan AI is an internal platform that enables teams and partners to **generate game content using AI**, including integrations with LINE and external APIs.

![overviewimg](https://res.cloudinary.com/dqtfjvkok/image/upload/v1763885175/Group_4047_k2efeh.png) 

The platform includes several internal tools and flows such as:

- Game creation & configuration  
- Project and asset management  
- Review & iteration processes  
- Internal utilities and a deployment-related portal used to manage generated builds  

However, the focus of this case study is the **overall redesign of the Zoan AI system**, from foundations to core flows — not a single module.

My work included:

- Conducting a full **UI Audit**  
- Rebuilding the **Design System** from scratch  
- Redesigning dashboards and key product flows  
- Improving the design → dev workflow  
- Automating token generation using **JSON → CSS conversion via AI**

## Phase 1 — Initial Challenges

### 🔥 UI & UX Issues Identified

When I joined Zoan AI, the platform suffered from multiple UI inconsistencies:

- Mixed spacing and color usage  
- Components built with different styles  
- Lack of hierarchy and clarity  
- Marketing visuals and product UI did not align  
- No shared design system → slowed both design and development

## My Approach

### 1. UI Audit

I began by mapping and categorizing every UI issue:

- Inconsistent layout structures  
- Incorrect brand colors  
- Duplicate components with mismatched styles  
- No standardized interaction patterns  

This helped establish a clear direction for the redesign.

### 2. Establishing the Foundations

I rebuilt the design foundations to create a unified system:

- Standardized **color palette** aligned with brand

- Defined **spacing, grid, and radius scale**  
- Established a **typography system**

- Created **design tokens** for color, spacing, typography, shadows, and borders

These foundations became the single source of truth for the entire platform.

### 3. Component Expansion

Building from the foundations, I redesigned and expanded the component library:

- Buttons & form elements  
- Lists, tables, and cards  
- Navigation (sidebar, top bar)  
- Overlays, dialogues, system states  

Components were built to support real product use cases — not just ideal scenarios.

### 4. Applying to Zoan AI

With the new foundations and components, I redesigned key parts of the platform:

- **Main dashboard** with improved hierarchy  
- **Game-generation flows**  
- **Project & asset management screens**  
- **Internal review and utility tools**  
- UI refinements for the deployment-related portal  

The result was a more predictable, consistent, and brand-aligned interface.

### 5. Developer Collaboration & Handoff

To make implementation smooth and accurate, I ensured:

- Detailed specifications through **Figma Dev Mode**  
- Clear rules for responsive behavior & interactions  
- Multiple design–dev feedback sessions  
- Real-time refinements based on technical constraints  

Collaboration with engineering became significantly faster and more predictable.

## Phase 2 — Improving Internal Workflow

### 🔥 Challenge

As the design system expanded, the number of tokens and variations increased.  
Developers needed to manually convert these tokens into CSS, which took time and introduced inconsistencies.

### 💡 Solution: Automating Token Conversion (JSON → CSS via AI)

To optimize the workflow:

1. I exported all Figma design tokens as **JSON**  
2. Used ChatGPT to automatically convert JSON → CSS  
3. Provided developers with clean, ready-to-use CSS tokens  

#### Benefits

- Saved significant developer time  
- Removed manual coding errors  
- Ensured perfect consistency between design & code  
- Enabled faster iteration for new features

## Outcome

The redesign resulted in:

- A **brand-consistent** and cohesive visual system  
- Cleaner and more modern UI across all screens  
- A scalable design system ready for new AI features  
- Faster implementation thanks to automated token workflows  
- Better alignment across Product, Marketing, and Engineering

## Closing Note

This project showed me that AI doesn’t replace designers —  
**it empowers us when we know how to work with it.**

In this case, I didn’t get replaced by AI.  
**I designed the interface that powers Zoan AI.**
