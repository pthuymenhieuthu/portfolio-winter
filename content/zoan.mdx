Before joining Zoan AI, I used to ask myself:  
## “Will AI replace UI/UX Designers?”

But leading this project—from system rebuilding and UI redesign to shaping cross-platform experiences—made me realize something else:

👉 **I wasn’t being replaced by AI. I was designing the interface *for* an AI platform.**

## Overview

Zoan AI enables teams and partners to build **AI-generated interactive content** through unified desktop workflows and a mobile chat-to-creation experience.

My responsibility covered the entire product surface:

• UI audit and redesign  
• Design system foundations & component library  
• Web & mobile experience alignment  

---

## Phase 1: Visual Challenges

As an early-stage product, the interface lacked structure and brand consistency.  
This became the starting point for rebuilding the system from the ground up.

---

## Phase 2: System Foundations

Resetting the visual language:

### Colors

### Typography

### Variable System

A scalable token structure ensured consistency across both desktop and mobile platforms.

---

## Phase 3: Component System

Building out the component library:

• Controls, forms, and overlays  
• Cards, lists, and tables  
• Navigation patterns  
• Clear state variations  

Each component included guidelines for behavior and implementation.

## Phase 4: Cross-Platform Application

### Desktop

• Dashboard and workflow management  
• Asset and content organization  
• Review and iteration screens

### Mobile Experience

The same system was adapted for smaller screens to enable:

• Chat-based creation  
• Interactive previews  
• Quick content iteration

## Phase 5: Motion & Micro-Interaction Design

Motion was introduced to:

• Guide attention and transitions  
• Reinforce hierarchy and interaction states  
• Elevate the experience beyond static UI  

### Timeline motion

### App transition motion

These animations were designed modularly to scale with future features.

## Outcome

The renewed system:

• Provided a scalable foundation for future development  
• Reduced design–engineering friction  
• Established a strong visual identity for fundraising and go-to-market  

Working on Zoan AI didn’t show me that AI replaces designers.  
**It showed me that designers shape how humans interact with AI.**
