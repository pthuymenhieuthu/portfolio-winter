Before starting this job, I kept asking myself:  
## “Will AI replace my role as a UI/UX Designer?”

But after taking ownership of this entire project, from rebuilding the design system, redesigning the interface, to shape the UI for Zoan AI. I realized something else:

👉 **I wasn’t being replaced by AI. I was designing the interface *for* an AI platform.**

## Overview

Zoan AI is an internal platform that allows teams and partners to create **AI-generated interactive content** through a suite of tools, workflows, and integrated mobile experiences.

My work stretched across the entire product surface:

• Conducting a complete UI audit  
• Rebuilding the Design System  
• Redesigning dashboards and internal creation flows  
• Designing the mobile chat-to-output experience  
• Aligning interaction patterns across platforms  
• Automating token conversion through JSON to CSS  

## Phase 1: Identifying Early Challenges

Because the product was still evolving, the UI showed early-stage inconsistencies.  
The main issues were clear:

**• The visuals didn’t align with the intended branding**  
**• The interface wasn’t clean or structured enough**

These became the foundation for rebuilding the design system.

## Phase 2: Rebuilding the Foundations

I rebuilt the visual language and token architecture.

### Colors

### Typography

### Variable System

These foundations became the shared source of truth across both desktop tools and mobile modules.

## Phase 3: Component System

With the foundations finalized, I expanded the component library:

• Buttons, inputs, and form structures  
• Lists, tables, cards  
• Navigation for web and mobile  
• Dialogs and overlays  
• State variations for loading, empty, success, and errors  

Every component was documented with interaction rules to ensure predictable implementation.

## Phase 4: Applying the System Across Platforms

### Task Definition and Flow Mapping

Before moving into UI design, our team started by outlining a comprehensive **task list** for each part of the system.  
The goal was to identify everything a user could possibly do, then break it into clear, manageable tasks.

From this list, I collaborated with the product and engineering teams to create **task flows** that mapped out how users move from one step to another.  
We defined:

• Starting points  
• End points  
• Main flows (happy paths)  
• Sub-flows  
• Edge cases and alternative paths (unhappy paths)

This structured process ensured that the design would hold up even when users encountered unusual scenarios or non-linear behavior.

By mapping task flows early, we were able to:

• Build alignment across the entire team  
• Reduce ambiguity before sprint work began  
• Identify dependencies between modules  
• Clarify interaction expectations for both desktop and mobile  
• Ensure no important path was overlooked  

This foundation allowed later sprints to move faster and with fewer surprises, because every screen and interaction had already been logically validated.

### Desktop Platform

Once the flows were validated, I applied the new design system across the desktop tools:

• The main dashboard  
• AI-assisted creation workflows  
• Content and asset management  
• Review and iteration screens  
• Internal management utilities  

The updated interface became more structured, predictable, and cohesive.

### Mobile Experience

On mobile, users could:

![mobileflow](https://res.cloudinary.com/dqtfjvkok/image/upload/v1763912731/Group_4048_ro0u6m.png)

The mobile UI adopted the same design language as the desktop system, adapted for smaller screens.  
This required defining message structures, interactive cards, preview modules, and a mobile-first navigation model.

The goal was to ensure that the ecosystem felt unified, whether accessed through desktop or mobile.

## Phase 5: Design to Engineering Collaboration

I documented all components and rules directly in Figma Dev Mode, including interaction logic and responsive behavior.  
We held regular design–engineering syncs to refine implementation and maintain visual fidelity.

### Automating Tokens

As the design system grew, token conversion became time-consuming.  
I introduced an automated workflow:

• Export tokens as JSON  
• Convert JSON to CSS using AI  
• Provide developers with clean, ready-to-use variables  

This kept implementation consistent and reduced manual work.

## Outcome

Even though the product is still in development and entering the fundraising stage, the redesign provided a clear and scalable foundation for everything that comes next.  
The new system aligned the entire platform under a single visual language, clarified core user flows, and made it easier for design and engineering to collaborate with confidence.

Once the product launches, success can be measured through a few key indicators:

• **Design system adoption rate** across new features  
• **Reduction in UI inconsistencies** and rework during sprints  
• **Task completion time** for the core creation and preview flows  

Working on Zoan AI didn’t show me that AI replaces designers.  
It showed me that designers shape how people understand and interact with AI — and here, I built the interface that the AI itself relies on to create.
