Before starting this job, I kept asking myself:  
## “Will AI replace my role as a UI/UX Designer?”

But after taking ownership of this entire project — rebuilding the design system, redesigning the interface, and shaping the UI for Zoan AI — I realized something else:

👉 **I wasn’t being replaced by AI. I was designing the interface *for* an AI platform.**

## Overview

Zoan AI is an internal platform that allows teams and partners to create **AI-generated interactive content** through a suite of tools, workflows, and integrated mobile experiences.

My work stretched across the entire product surface:

• Conducting a complete UI audit  
• Rebuilding the Design System  
• Redesigning dashboards and internal creation flows  
• Designing the mobile chat-to-output experience  
• Aligning interaction patterns across platforms  
• Automating token conversion through JSON to CSS  

## Phase 1: Understanding the Problem

The platform had grown rapidly, which led to visual fragmentation.  
There were mismatched components, inconsistent spacing, conflicting color usage, and no unified design language between desktop and mobile.

I mapped the entire system, identifying issues in structure, hierarchy, and consistency.  
This audit became the foundation of the redesign.

## Phase 2: Rebuilding the Foundations

I rebuilt the visual language and token architecture.

### Colors

### Typography

### Variable System

These foundations became the shared source of truth across both desktop tools and mobile modules.

## Phase 3: Component System

With the foundations finalized, I expanded the component library:

• Buttons, inputs, and form structures  
• Lists, tables, cards  
• Navigation for web and mobile  
• Dialogs and overlays  
• State variations for loading, empty, success, and errors  

Every component was documented with interaction rules to ensure predictable implementation.

## Phase 4: Applying the System Across Platforms

### Task Flow Mapping

Before designing any screen, I created detailed task flows to map how users moved through the system from start to end.  
This included both happy paths and potential edge cases, ensuring the experience stayed stable even under unexpected scenarios.

These flows aligned the entire team around the same mental model and made it easier to break work into manageable increments for later sprints.  
By the time the UI phase began, we had already validated the structure of the experience.

### Desktop Platform

I redesigned key areas including:

• The main dashboard  
• AI-assisted creation flows  
• Content and asset management  
• Review and iteration tools  
• Internal utilities for handling generated outputs  

The updated system became more structured, scalable, and visually consistent.

### Mobile Experience

The mobile side enabled users to:

• Chat with the AI engine  
• Receive structured, interactive outputs  
• Preview the generated content  
• Interact with lightweight modules used for testing  
• Access internal tools, user settings, and utilities

Designing this experience required adapting the system to smaller screens while keeping everything consistent.  
The chat output required defining message structure, interaction states, content cards, preview modules, and loading patterns.

A major goal was ensuring web and mobile felt like one connected ecosystem.\

## Phase 5: Design to Engineering Collaboration

I documented all components and rules directly in Figma Dev Mode, including interaction logic and responsive behavior.  
We held regular design–engineering syncs to refine implementation and maintain visual fidelity.

### Automating Tokens

As the design system grew, token conversion became time-consuming.  
I introduced an automated workflow:

• Export tokens as JSON  
• Convert JSON to CSS using AI  
• Provide developers with clean, ready-to-use variables  

This kept implementation consistent and reduced manual work.

## Outcome

The product evolved into:

• A unified design system covering both desktop and mobile  
• A scalable foundation ready for future AI-driven features  
• A cohesive visual identity that strengthened cross-team alignment  
• Faster implementation through automated workflows  
• A seamless interface powering AI-generated interactive experiences  

## Closing Note

Working on Zoan AI didn’t show me that AI replaces designers.  
It showed me that designers shape how people understand, use, and trust AI.

And in this project, I designed the interface that AI uses to create.
