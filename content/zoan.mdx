## Overview  

During my internship, I worked on two design tasks closely tied to **user experience and brand consistency**:  

1. **Redesigning onboarding illustrations** to increase engagement and reduce skip rates.  
2. **Supporting the landing page design** for [trueprofit.io](https://trueprofit.io/) by drafting layout ideas and illustrations aligned with the brand system.  

Both tasks required me to translate abstract product goals into **clear visual storytelling**, while keeping alignment with the existing design system and marketing direction.
