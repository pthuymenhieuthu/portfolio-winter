title: "Zoan AI – Design System & Product Redesign"
publishedAt: "2025-05"
summary: "I once wondered if AI would replace designers. Then I joined Zoan AI, where I designed the cross-platform system an AI engine relies on to create interactive experiences."

Before joining Zoan AI, I used to ask myself:  
## “Will AI replace UI/UX Designers?”

But leading this project from system rebuilding, UI redesign to cross-platform experience made me realize:

👉 **I wasn’t being replaced by AI. I was designing the interface *for* an AI platform.**

## Overview

Zoan AI enables teams and partners to build **AI-generated interactive content** through unified desktop workflows and a mobile chat-to-creation experience.

My responsibility covered the entire product surface:

• UI audit and redesign  
• Design system foundations + library  
• Web & mobile experience alignment

## Phase 1: Visual Challenges

Being an early-stage product, the interface lacked structure and brand consistency — this became the base for rebuilding the system.

---

## Phase 2: System Foundations

Resetting the visual language:

### Colors

### Typography

### Variable System

A scalable token structure ensured consistency across both desktop and mobile.

## Phase 3: Component System

Building out the library:

• Controls, forms, overlays  
• Cards, lists, tables  
• Navigation patterns  
• Clear state variations  

Each component included guidelines for behavior + implementation.

## Phase 4: Cross-Platform Application

### Desktop

• Dashboard & workflows  
• Asset/content organization  
• Review & iteration screens

### Mobile Experience

The same system adapted for smaller screens to enable:

• Chat-based creation  
• Interactive previews  
• Quick content iteration

## Phase 5: Motion & Micro-Interaction Design

Motion was introduced to:

• Guide attention and transitions  
• Reinforce hierarchy and interaction states  
• Elevate the experience beyond static UI

### Timeline motion

### App transition motion

These animations were built modularly to scale with future features.

## Outcome

The renewed system:

• Provided a scalable foundation for future development  
• Reduced design–engineering friction  
• Established a strong visual identity for fundraising and go-to-market

Working on Zoan AI didn’t show me that AI replaces designers —  
**It showed me that designers shape how humans interact with AI.**
